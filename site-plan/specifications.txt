1. Overview
The AI-Driven Requirements Analyzer is a web application that enables users to upload software requirements documents (text or PDF), 
processes them through a machine learning pipeline, and provides extracted, classified, and improved requirements using both traditional 
ML libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy) and Generative AI (LLMs). The app exposes its ML predictions through a REST API and presents 
results in a responsive, accessible web interface.

2. Goals & Objectives
Automate the extraction and classification of requirements from documents.
Detect ambiguities, inconsistencies, and suggest improvements using GenAI.
Expose ML predictions and suggestions via a Python-based REST API.
Demonstrate data pipeline engineering and ML integration in a web app.
Build a user-friendly, accessible, and responsive interface suitable for business users and engineers.

3. Target Users
Software engineers, business analysts, and project managers who need to analyze, clarify, and improve requirements documents.

4. Core Features
Frontend
Home Page:
Brief introduction and instructions.
File upload form (accepts .txt and .pdf).
Link to results/history page.
At least one relevant image.
Results Page (Child Page):
Display extracted requirements in a list/table.
Show AI-generated suggestions for improvement.
Highlight ambiguities or inconsistencies.
Option to copy/download results.
Navigation back to home or history.
History/Dashboard Page (Optional):
List of past analyses with timestamps.

Backend
File Ingestion & Preprocessing:
Parse uploaded files (text/PDF) and extract raw text.
Preprocess text (tokenization, cleaning) using pandas/NumPy.

ML Pipeline:
Use scikit-learn (or similar) for basic classification (e.g., functional vs. nonfunctional requirements).
Integrate with LLM API (e.g., OpenAI) for ambiguity detection and improvement suggestions.

REST API:
Endpoints for file upload, requirements extraction, and results retrieval.
Follows Python coding standards and best practices.

General
Responsive and accessible design.
Valid HTML/CSS and visually appealing layout.
Dynamic DOM interactions (loading spinners, interactive lists, etc.).
Conditional branching (error states, empty uploads, ambiguous requirements).
Use of objects, arrays, and array methods (map, filter, etc.) in the frontend1.
Testing scripts for API and data integrity.

5. Technical Requirements
Frontend: React (preferred), or HTML/CSS/JavaScript (with ES modules and objects1).
Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI).
ML Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn.
GenAI Integration: OpenAI or Hugging Face API for advanced text analysis.
Cloud Readiness: Containerized (Docker), deployable to AWS/GCP or similar.
Testing: Unit and integration tests for API and ML pipeline.
Deployment: Hosted on the web (Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Render/Railway for backend).

6. User Flow
Home Page:
User uploads a requirements document.
Clicks “Analyze.”
Backend Processing:
File is parsed and preprocessed.
ML pipeline extracts and classifies requirements.
LLM detects ambiguities and generates suggestions.
Results Page:
User sees a list of extracted requirements, classifications, and AI-generated suggestions.
Can copy/download results or view analysis history.

7. Wireframe Descriptions
Home Page:
Header, instructions, file upload form, image, link to results/history.
Results Page:
Table/list of requirements, ambiguity highlights, suggestions, copy/download buttons, navigation.
History Page (optional):
List of previous analyses, clickable for details.

8. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Fast processing for small/medium documents.
Accessibility: Passes Lighthouse accessibility checks (≥96).
Security: Validate file types/sizes, sanitize inputs.
Maintainability: Modular, well-documented code.

9. Success Criteria
User can upload a document and receive extracted/classified requirements with AI suggestions.
App is responsive, accessible, and visually appealing.
REST API exposes ML predictions.
Code uses objects, arrays, and array methods in the frontend1.
Testing scripts validate API and ML outputs.
Meets course rubric and demonstrates skills relevant to ML engineering roles.
